<h1>Welcome to the Shogun cloud!</h1>
<p>
This service allows you to try Shogun from your browser in an interactive <a href="http://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">jupyter</a> notebook.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
You can start and stop the service as you wish.
While we aim to offer this service to as many people as possible, we have limited resources.
We don't restrict usage time, but we kindly ask you to stop the session after you are done.
You will also be automatically logged out after a certain time.
Your results are available on the next log-in.
</p>

<h3>Example notebooks</h3>
<p>
All of the notebooks from our website <a href="http://shogun.ml/showroom" target="_blank">showroom</a> are available as demos.
Note that they are all read-only, which means that you can run them but you cannot save modifications on them.
If you want to store your changes, please open a terminal (New->Terminal) and copy the notebook from into your home folder (e.g. 'cp shogun-demos/ipython-notebooks/regression/Regression.ipynb my_writable_copy.ipynb').
You can also start your own notebook from scratch.
</p>

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
<p>
This service is kindly supported by Amazon's AWS cloud credits for research program.
